02 Git & GitHub
===============
**Prerequisite:** [01 Console Introduction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLW_QYikQfAa5ijx7wuqtFaTZ80Ho9Q34tHCbNuFpTI/pub) And [01 Git Install & GitHub Account](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wzbt_mnjb49T07346TfcOuKAAHPcX1whzGCAdsEG7WU/pub) _(These exercises should be done before the beginning of this class)_   
## Overview ##
In this class we will focus on versioning control systems. You already know versioning control from many software programs like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Photoshop and the ctrl+z key on your computer. It basically is a system that can keep track of the history of your files.   

We will focus on Git, and you will get a basic introduction to this system. Git can be very complex to work with, but we will only look at a few basic areas and commands, and these are easy to learn.
During this semester you will be working with Git and be using it extensively. And when you after the computer science education get a job, you will almost for sure be using the same system and the same commands.


## Objectives ##
When we are done today you will have Git installed on your computer, and you will have created an online account on GitHub.   
You will be able to clone an online repository to your local computer, and be able to update this local repository whenever you want to.   
You will be able to add, commit and push files to your own online repository.   
And you will be able to work together with your group on the same files
