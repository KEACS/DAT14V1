This repository will contain all code examples from the teaching and also a description of  the lessons (Overview, learning objectives, links to material, tutorials etc.)   
So we will not be using fronter this semester i SWC (exempt for a few mandatory assignments hand-ins).   

Clone this repository to your own computer (description on how: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8hfHViX0InQqDZwv5BCntVnbZQdOv-OdCyWznlZsw8/pub)

A new folder will be added to the repository before every class, and material will be added during or right after the classes.
