# 03 Brush-up project #
This week you will continue the Brush-up project you started last week in software design, and implement your design into code.   

It should be straight forward, and there is not a lot of additional requirements. So take your design and turn it into a program.   

Two specific SWC requirement is that you have to use **ArrayList**, and you have to be able to, at least **read from a text file** on your HD.   

Each group will precent their project next week (tuesday, dat14v1 - wedensday dat14w) in the first lesson. Each group only have 5 minutes for the presentation, so you need to plan what you want to show.

All group members also has to push the code to their own hand-in repository on GitHub

Good luck!
