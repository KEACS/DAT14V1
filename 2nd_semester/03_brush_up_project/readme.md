# 03 Brush-up project #
This week you will continue the Brush-up project you started last week in software design, and implement your design into code.   

It should be straight forward, and there is not a lot of additional requirements. So take your design and turn it into a program.   

Two specific SWC requirement is that you have to use **ArrayList**, and you have to be able to, at least **read from a text file** on your HD.   

Each group will precent their project next week (Tuesday, dat14v1 - Wednesday dat14w) in the first lesson. Each group only have 5 minutes for the presentation, so you need to plan what you want to show.   

**The presentation of your project should contain**   
* A short demonstration of your program.
* Show the connection between your design diagrams and your code
* An explanation of how you used git and Github in your group, and an evaluation on how it went (pros & cons).   

All group members also has to push the source code to their own hand-in/Exercises repository on GitHub.

Good luck!
