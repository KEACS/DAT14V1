	Write a method called writeNums that takes an integer n as a parameter and prints to the console the first n integers
	starting with 1 in sequential order, separated by commas. For example, consider the following calls:
	writeNums(5);
	writeNums(12);
	These calls should produce the following output:
	1, 2, 3, 4, 5
	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
	Your method should throw an IllegalArgumentException if passed a value less than 1.
